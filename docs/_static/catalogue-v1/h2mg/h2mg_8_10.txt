Two 8-dimensional clusters, each with 1024 points. Each point is sampled
from a sphere centered at its own cluster's centre, of radius that follows
the Gaussian distribution with scale 10*8.

`labels0` gives reference labels based on which probability distribution's
mixture component was used to generate the corresponding points.
`labels1` gives reference labels based on the distance to
the true cluster centre (i.e., arg max_ p_i(x)).
There is no noise class.
