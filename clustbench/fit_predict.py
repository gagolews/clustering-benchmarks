def fit_predict_many(model, data, n_clusters):
    """
    Determine many clusterings of the same dataset.

    Ideally, for hierarchical methods, it would be best
    if ``model`` was implemented smartly enough
    that for the same ``X`` and different ``n_clusters``
    it does not recompute the whole hierarchy from scratch.


    Parameters
    ----------

    model
        An object equipped with ``fit_predict``
        and ``set_param`` methods (e.g., a `scikit-learn`-like class)

    data : array-like
        Data matrix.

    n_clusters : int or list of ints
        Number of clusters.


    Returns
    -------

    results
        A dictionary of label vectors,
        where ``results[K]`` gives the discovered ``K``-partition.
