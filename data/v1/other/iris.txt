The (? - see below) famous Fisher's *iris* data set.

Source: Fisher R.A. (1936). The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic
problems, Annual Eugenics 7, pp. 179-188.

Note that there are many flavors of this dataset available on the internet.
Here, we use the one available in the R package `datasets`
(as of R version 3.5.1). In particular, the one available in the UCI repository
has errors in rows #35 and #38.

For discussion, see: Bezdek J.C. et al. (1999). Will the real iris data please
stand up?, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems 7(3), pp. 368-369.
