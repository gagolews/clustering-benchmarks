An imbalanced version of the famous Fisher's *iris* data set,
in which we take only 5 last observations from the 1st group (*iris setosa*).
This benchmark set was proposed in Gagolewski M., Bartoszuk M., Cena A. (2016).

Note that there are many flavors of this dataset available on the internet.
Here, we use the one available in the R package `datasets`
(as of R version 3.5.1).
