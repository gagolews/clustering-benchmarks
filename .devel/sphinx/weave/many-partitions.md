**Ground-truth/reference label vectors are provided alongside each dataset.**
These have been created by various experts.
They define the desired number of clusters, `k`.

Cluster similarity measures (such as the adjusted Rand index or
normalised mutual information score,
see, e.g., Hubert and Arabie, 1985) can be used to compare
the agreement between the reference and the generated partition.


Nevertheless, we strongly believe that it is in the very spirit
of unsupervised learning that for some datasets,
**there might be multiple equally valid/plausible/useful partitions**
(see also Dasgupta and Ng, 2009 for discussion). That is why
many benchmark sets come with alternative labellings.
Therefore, we claim that the
outputs generated by a single algorithm
should be  evaluated against all the available reference labellings
and the *maximal* similarity score should be reported.
