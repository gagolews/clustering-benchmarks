# There Can Be Many Valid Partitions


we strongly believe that it is in the very spirit
of unsupervised learning that for some datasets,
**there might be multiple equally valid/plausible/useful partitions**
(see also Dasgupta and Ng, 2009 for discussion). That is why
many benchmark sets come with alternative labellings.
Therefore, we claim that the
outputs generated by a single algorithm
should be  evaluated against all the available reference labellings
and the *maximal* similarity score should be reported.

Consider the {ref}`graves/parabolic <sec:data-v1>` dataset {cite}`graves`:






```python
import numpy as np
import clustbench
data_url = "https://github.com/gagolews/clustering-data-v1/raw/master"
benchmark = clustbench.load_dataset("graves", "parabolic", url=data_url)
len(benchmark.labels)
## 2
import genieclust
for i in range(len(benchmark.labels)):
    plt.subplot(1, len(benchmark.labels), i+1)
    genieclust.plots.plot_scatter(
        benchmark.data, labels=benchmark.labels[i]-1,
        axis="equal", title=f"labels{i}"
    )

plt.show()
```

(fig:many-paritions)=
```{figure} many-partitions-figures/many-paritions-1.*
Does this dataset consist of two paraboles or four spherical blobs? There can be many equally valid partitions.
```
