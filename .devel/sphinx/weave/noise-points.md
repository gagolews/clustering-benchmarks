# Noise Points


Some datasets feature **noise points**
to make the clustering problem more difficult
(e.g., outliers or irrelevant points in-between actual clusters).
They are specially marked in the ground-truth vectors (cluster ID=0).


## Example

For example, consider the {ref}`other/hdbscan <sec:suite-v1>` dataset
{cite}`hdbscanpkg`, which consists of 2309 points in $\mathbb{R}^2$.



```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import clustbench
# Accessing <https://github.com/gagolews/clustering-data-v1> directly:
data_url = "https://github.com/gagolews/clustering-data-v1/raw/master"
benchmark = clustbench.load_dataset("other", "hdbscan", url=data_url)
X = benchmark.data
y_true = benchmark.labels[0]
```

Here is a summary of the number of points in each cluster
in the reference partition $\mathbf{y}$:



```python
pd.Series(y_true).value_counts()
## 0    510
## 1    410
## 2    366
## 3    326
## 4    306
## 5    207
## 6    184
## dtype: int64
```

There are six clusters (1â€“6)
and a special point group with ID of 0 that marks
some points as noise.



```python
import genieclust
genieclust.plots.plot_scatter(X, labels=y_true-1, axis="equal", title="y_true")
plt.show()
```

## Discovering Clusters

Suppose we want to evaluate how [Genie](https://genieclust.gagolewski.com)
handles such a noisy dataset.

::::{important}
The algorithm must
not be informed about the exact location of such problematic points.
After all, it is an unsupervised learning task.
::::




```python
k = np.max(y_true)  # number of clusters to detect
g = genieclust.Genie(n_clusters=k)  # using default parameters
y_pred = g.fit_predict(X) + 1  # +1 makes cluster IDs in 1..k, not 0..(k-1)
```

Below we plot the reference the predicted ($\hat{\mathbf{y}}$) partition.
Additionally, we draw a version of $\hat{\mathbf{y}}$ whose
noise point markers are propagated from  ($\mathbf{y}$)
(as a kind of data postprocessing).




```python
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
genieclust.plots.plot_scatter(X, labels=y_pred-1, axis="equal", title="y_pred")
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
y_pred2 = np.where(y_true > 0, y_pred, 0)  # y_pred, but noise points get ID=0
genieclust.plots.plot_scatter(X, labels=y_pred2-1, axis="equal",
    title="y_pred (noise from y_true)")
plt.show()
```

Noise points make the life of a clustering algorithm harder.
```


## Evaluating Similarity

Here is the confusion matrix:



```python
genieclust.compare_partitions.confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
## array([[116,  84, 124,  51,  52,  83],
##        [409,   0,   1,   0,   0,   0],
##        [366,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0],
##        [  0,  24,   0,   0, 298,   4],
##        [  0, 306,   0,   0,   0,   0],
##        [  0,   0,   0, 207,   0,   0],
##        [  0,   0, 184,   0,   0,   0]])
```

The first row denotes the "noise cluster": we do not actually
care how the algorithm classifies such points. After all, most classical
algorithms are not equipped with noise point detectors[^footnoisedetect]
and they should not be penalised for this.

Genie discovered four clusters very well (3, 4, 5, 6),
but failed on the first two (it created a "combined" cluster instead
and considered some noise points as a separate point group).


::::{important}
Once a clustering is obtained,
when computing external cluster validity measures,
we should omit the noise points whatsoever.
::::


We can thus compute the adjusted asymmetric accuracy,
ignoring the first row in the confusion matrix:



```python
genieclust.compare_partitions.adjusted_asymmetric_accuracy(
    y_true[y_true>0],
    y_pred[y_true>0]
)
## 0.7828220858895705
```

The score is somewhere between 4/6 (four clusters discovered correctly)
and 5/6 (one cluster definitely missed).



[^footnoisedetect]: Some algorithms have built-in noise point detectors
    (e.g., [HDBSCAN\*](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    and [Genie](https://genieclust.gagolewski.com)).
    These can also be evaluated using some of the datasets from our battery,
    but we are not interested in this problem in the current context.
