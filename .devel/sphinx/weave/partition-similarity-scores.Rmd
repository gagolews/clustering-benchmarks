# Partition Similarity Scores

Let $X=\{\mathbf{x}_1, \dots, \mathbf{x}_n\}$ be the input dataset
that consists of $n$ objects.

Assume we are given a $k$-partition[^footpart] $\{X_1,\dots,X_k\}$ of $X$
encoded by means of a *label vector*[^footsurj] $\mathbf{y}$, where
$y_i\in[1:k]$ gives the cluster number (ID) of the $i$-th object.

Furthermore, let $\hat{mathbf{y}}$ be a label vector
encoding another partition, $\{\hat{X}_1,\dots,\hat{X}_l\}$,
possibly with $l\neq k$.

[^footpart]: We say that $\{X_1,\dots,X_k\}$ is a $k$-partition of $X$,
    if each $X_i$ is nonempty, $X_i\cap X_j=\emptyset$ for $i\neq j$,
    and $\bigcup_{i=1}^k X_i=X$.

[^footsurj]: More precisely, a surjection $[1:n]\stackrel{\text{onto}}{\to}[1:k]$.

Partition similarity scores aim to quantify the similarity between
$\mathbf{y}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{y}}$.

...

$\mathbf{y}$ - reference partition (expert labels)

$\hat{\mathbf{y}}$ - output of a clustering algorithm

can be used as external cluster validity
measures â€” for comparing the outputs of clustering algorithms
with reference (ground truth) labels

small dataset, e.g., iris example
output of kmeans

Let $\mathbf{C}$ be the
confusion matrix (with :math:`K` rows and :math:`L` columns, :math:`K \\leq L`)
corresponding to `x` and `y`, see also
`genieclust.compare_partitions.confusion_matrix`.



Every index except `mi_score` (which computes the mutual
information score) outputs the value of 1.0 if two identical partitions
are given.
Note that partitions are always defined up to a bijection of the set of
possible labels, e.g., (1, 1, 2, 1) and (4, 4, 2, 4)
represent the same 2-partition.

Their implementation is included
in the [*genieclust*](https://genieclust.gagolewski.com/) package for Python.
